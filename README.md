Converting my 61 key keyboard to MIDI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Keys that are next to each other are still not detected together. 
That's a problem for another day. 
I'll solve it when I need to press neighbouring keys.

To play the keyboard with MIDI without updating firmware
==========================================================
1) hairless MIDI
2) loopMIDI

MIDI baudrate is 31250.

"NB: To convey Windows MIDI data from one bit of software to another, youâ€™ll need a Virtual MIDI passthrough driver. We recommend loopMIDI, or there is alternatively the older MIDI Yoke (MIDI Yoke is not recomended for Vista or newer.)"

TO REPROGRAM ARDUINO'S ATMEGA CHIP
==================================
This is to update the program.


1) http://morecatlab.akiba.coocan.jp/lab/index.php/aruino/midi-firmware-for-arduino-uno-moco/?lang=en
Before connecting Uno to PC, install a jumper between pin4 and pin6 on ICSP connector (this is the USB connector ICSP not the Mega ICSP) for Mega8u2/16U2. With the jumper, Arduino-serial mode is initiated. You can use Arduino IDE to program mega328 on Uno.

There's a picture on the website. Look at it for help.
